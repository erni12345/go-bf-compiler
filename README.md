# Brainfuck Compiler

This project is a Brainfuck compiler written in Go. The purpose of this project is to improve my Go programming skills while exploring the intricacies of the Brainfuck programming language.

## About Brainfuck

Brainfuck is an esoteric programming language created in 1993 by Urban MÃ¼ller. It is known for its minimalism and extreme simplicity. Despite its minimalistic nature, Brainfuck is Turing complete, meaning it can compute anything that a Turing machine can. The language consists of only eight commands:

- `>`: Move the pointer to the right
- `<`: Move the pointer to the left
- `+`: Increment the memory cell at the pointer
- `-`: Decrement the memory cell at the pointer
- `[`: Jump past the matching `]` if the cell at the pointer is 0
- `]`: Jump back to the matching `[` if the cell at the pointer is nonzero
- `.`: Output the character at the pointer
- `,`: Input a character and store it in the cell at the pointer

Despite its simplicity, Brainfuck can be used to write complex programs.

## How to Compile Brainfuck Programs

To compile a Brainfuck program, you first need to compile the Go program included in this repository. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```
https://github.com/erni12345/go-bf-compiler.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd brainfuck-compiler
```

3. Compile the Go program:
```
go build
```

This will generate an executable file named `brainfuck-compiler` or `brainfuck-compiler.exe` depending on your operating system.

4. Now, you can use the generated executable to compile Brainfuck programs. Run the following command:
```
./brainfuck-compiler <name-of-file.bf> <mode>
```
Current modes : `interpret`
Replace `<name-of-file.bf>` with the filename of your Brainfuck program, and mode with the mode. **Soon** this will compile the Brainfuck program into executable code. For now just runs.

That's it! You've successfully compiled a Brainfuck program using this compiler.
